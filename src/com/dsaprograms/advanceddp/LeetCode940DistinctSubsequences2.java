LeetCode Hard: 940. Distinct Subsequences II
https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences-ii/submissions/
Given a string S, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of S .
Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
Example 1:
Input: "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
Example 2:
Input: "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa" and "aba".
Example 3:
Input: "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".

    /* why +mod is required in this line dp[i]-=(((dp[last[S[i-1]]]%mod)+mod)%mod);
            Now for example lets take mod = 5
            lets suppose dp[i-1] = 4 &  dp[i] = 6
            now since dp[i] is more than 5, we have to take mod. Now it will become 1

            now since I'm doing a subtraction
            dp[i]-=dp[i-1]  // dp[i] will become -3
            dp[i] has become negative, so I am adding mod, because technically it changes nothing in the answer! // now dp[i] will become -3+5 =2
            And because of that dp[i] has again become positive!
            we dont want dp[i] to be negative, so remember whenever there is a substraction involved in the question and a mod is involved, adding a mod becomes mandatory for us!
